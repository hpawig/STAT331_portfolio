For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature
of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g.,
boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions.

I included my revision for Lab 4 because it demonstrated my commitment to
revising my thinking, and I included the revision for Challenge 9 because 
it displays an example of extended learning. I also attached a reflection from a
revision of my Lab 3 because I think that it was a significant learning moment
for me in the course, where I finally understood the use of the here package.
