In statistical computing and data science, efficiency is the way to a solution that saves the most time, requires less steps, produces an accurate output consistently, and is the most modern. In data science and statistical computation, when using Rstudio it can look like a small and concise chunk that uses the "tidyverse" R package to filter and extract necessary data to create a more focused data table that can be used for summaries or visualizations without too many extra unnecessary tools. Efficiency allows for those who work in these fields to create complex outputs of many data types to be used for statistical analyses using a method where others can reproduce a similar output to do their own investigations. Being efficient is significant because it reduces unnecessary extra labor, saves time, and builds better modern solutions that can be passed onto others in the field.

One a-ha moment I had in terms of having a more efficient line of code was my first use of the %in% operator to filter my dataset that satisfied being in a certain range of a variable in Lab 3 question 10. The use of this operator inside of filter also makes it easily understandable to see what range of values I was filtering city by, as opposed to writing several lines inside the filter function using Boolean expressions such as city == 10000. Another efficiency encounter was in Lab 8, where we used a previously created function (pluralize_gift) that would be used in a new function we created, make_phrase, which then was used in a sing_line function that could produce the full lyrics of "The 12 Days of Christmas" song in along with a mapping and two concatenating functions. I realized that creating functions that contain clearly defined prospective outputs can help make a large task such as writing the lyrics for a repetitive song much simpler, through iteration and minimal code writing because of reused functions.
